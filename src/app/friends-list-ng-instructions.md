2. friends-list-ng:  
Refer back to page 51 in your book where you created a TS friends list project.
Create something similar in Angular.  

a) You should only need one component for this (using app component is fine).  

A.1) The top of the page should display all the fields for a friend:  name, age, email, bff, 

A.2) And an 'Add' button.

B.1) Below the add button is a table of your friends, which displays all the friends in your array of friends, which is stored in your ts file as a property.  

B.2) Clicking the 'add' button will call a function in your component ts that creates an instance of Friend and adds it to the array of Friends.


BONUS:  add a remove button!
